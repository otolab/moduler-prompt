# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.

**Current Phase: Planning**

- Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
- Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Create 3-5 concrete steps to achieve the objective
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)
- Start directly with { and end with }

### 応答:

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: :
Based on the available proteins and vegetables, as well as the restrictions, I have identified potential main dishes for tonight's dinner. Here are the options:

1. Stir-fried chicken with mixed vegetables: Using the available chicken and a variety of vegetables such as bell peppers, carrots, and cabbage, this dish can be seasoned with soy sauce, salt, and pepper for a flavorful and balanced meal. This option is appealing because it utilizes a protein that hasn't been used in the past two days and incorporates a variety of vegetables.

2. Tofu and vegetable curry: With tofu and a selection of vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and onions, this dish can be seasoned with curry powder, turmeric, and coconut milk for a warm and comforting meal. This option is a good choice because it avoids repeating the same protein type consecutively and incorporates a variety of vegetables.

3. Stuffed bell peppers with rice and vegetables: Using the available bell peppers and a mix of other vegetables like onions, carrots, and tomatoes, this dish can be seasoned with cumin, paprika, and salt for a Mediterranean-inspired meal. This option is a creative way to use the available ingredients and provides a balanced and flavorful main dish.

In conclusion, any of these options would be suitable for tonight's dinner, taking into account the available ingredients and the restrictions. I hope this helps you make an informed decision!

### 応答:

Execution step step-3 - AI generated: : Based on the available proteins and vegetables, as well as the restrictions, I propose the following side dishes that pair well with the selected main dish:

1. For Stir-fried chicken with mixed vegetables:
  - Roasted sweet potato wedges: The natural sweetness of the sweet potato complements the savory flavors of the stir-fried chicken. To avoid using the same ingredients as the main dish, ensure the sweet potato is not mixed with any of the vegetables used in the stir-fry.
  - Sautéed green beans with garlic and lemon: The bright flavors of garlic and lemon add a refreshing contrast to the rich stir-fried dish. Plus, green beans provide a variety of colors and nutrients.

2. For Tofu and vegetable curry:
  - Quinoa pilaf with sautéed kale and sun-dried tomatoes: Quinoa offers a nutritious and gluten-free alternative to rice. The kale adds a pop of green, while the sun-dried tomatoes provide a subtle sweetness that complements the curry.
  - Pickled red onions: The tangy and slightly sweet flavor of pickled red onions adds a delightful contrast to the creamy curry. Plus, they provide a burst of color and nutrients.

3. For Stuffed bell peppers with rice and vegetables:
  - Roasted asparagus with lemon-tahini sauce: The nutty and slightly tangy flavors of the lemon-tahini sauce create a delicious contrast to the Mediterranean-inspired stuffed bell peppers. Asparagus adds a variety of colors and nutrients.
  - Creamy avocado and cucumber salad: The creamy and cooling texture of the avocado salad provides a refreshing contrast to the warm stuffed bell peppers. Plus, it includes a variety of colors and nutrients.

In all cases, ensure that the side dishes do not share the same ingredients as the main dish and have not been served in the past meals.
