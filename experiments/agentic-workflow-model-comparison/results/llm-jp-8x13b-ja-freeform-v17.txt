# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.
- **Current Phase: Planning**
  - Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
  - Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Break down the **Objective and Instructions shown above** into 3-5 concrete executable steps
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
  - **dos**: Specific actions or guidelines TO DO in this step
  - **donts**: Specific actions or guidelines NOT TO DO in this step
- The steps should accomplish the Instructions in a logical sequence
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)
- Start directly with { and end with }

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: :
Based on the current state of the refrigerator inventory, here are some potential main dish options:

1. Chicken and Vegetable Stir Fry: Utilize the 鶏もも肉 (300g) and vegetables such as ピーマン and もやし. Season with 醤油, 酒, and ごま油 for a flavorful dish.
2. Tofu and Vegetable Curry: Use the 豆腐 (1丁) and vegetables like 人参, じゃがいも, and 玉ねぎ. Add カレールー or カレー粉 for a comforting main course.
3. Vegetable Fried Rice: Incorporate the 卵 (6個) and vegetables such as キャベツ, 人参, and もやし. Season with 醤油, 塩, and コショウ for a simple yet satisfying dish.

To ensure at least one main dish option is identified, I have provided three potential options. The next step would be to select the most preferred option or create a combination of these ideas to make a final decision.

### 応答:

Execution step step-2 - AI generated: :
Based on the past meals data, the last main dish served was カレーライス（豚肉・じゃがいも・人参・玉ねぎ）on 昨日. Therefore, to avoid repetition, we should not choose a main dish that includes these ingredients.

From the refrigerator inventory, we have 鶏もも肉 (300g), 豚バラ肉 (200g), 卵 (6個), and 豆腐 (1丁) as protein options. Since 豚バラ肉 was used in the past two days, we should avoid using it for the main dish in this step. This leaves us with 鶏もも肉, 卵, and 豆腐 as potential main dish options.

Considering the above, here are some main dish options for this step:

1. 鶏もも肉の照り焼き: Use the 鶏もも肉 (300g) and season with 醤油, みりん, and 砂糖 for a flavorful dish. This option is simple and can be easily prepared with minimal effort.
2. 卵と野菜の炒め物: Utilize the 卵 (6個) and select vegetables such as キャベツ, 人参, and もやし. Season with 塩, コショウ, and 醤油 for a quick and easy dish. This option can be easily adjusted to accommodate dietary preferences or restrictions.
3. 豆腐ステーキ: Use the 豆腐 (1丁) and season with 醤油, みりん, and 生姜 for a healthier main dish option. This dish can be served with steamed vegetables or rice for a balanced meal.

To ensure at least one main dish option is identified, I have provided three potential options. The next step would be to select the most preferred option or create a combination of these ideas to make a final decision.

Please note that the chosen dish should not include ingredients from the past two days' meals, and the review of past meals should be taken into account.

To ensure at least one main dish option is identified, I have provided three potential options. The next step would be to select the most preferred option or create a combination of these ideas to make a final decision.

Please note that the chosen dish should not include ingredients from the past two days' meals, and the review of past meals should be taken into account.


[Step 3] step-3
:
Based on the given instructions and the current state of the refrigerator inventory, here are two side dish options that complement the chosen main dish:

1. 野菜の浅漬け: Use the remaining vegetables such as キャベツ, 人参, and/or ピーマン. Slice the vegetables thinly and marinate them in a mixture of 塩, 酢, and 砂糖 for at least 30 minutes. This side dish will add a refreshing crunch to the main dish and can be prepared in advance.

2. 味噌汁: Use the 乾燥わかめ and select one or more of the following vegetables: じゃがいも, 玉ねぎ, or 豆腐. Add the chosen vegetables to the 鍋, then add the わかめ and 味噌汁の素 or 味噌. This side dish will provide a comforting and warming element to the meal, and it can be easily adjusted to accommodate dietary preferences or restrictions.

These side dish options are designed to complement the chosen main dish while considering flavor and texture combinations. They are also versatile and can be adapted to various dietary preferences or restrictions.
