# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.

**Current Phase: Planning**

- Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
- Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Create 3-5 concrete steps to achieve the objective
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)
- Start directly with { and end with }

### 応答:

Execution step step-2 - AI generated: :
Based on the available refrigerator items and the instructions provided, here are some potential side dish options that complement the chosen main dish while ensuring variety and avoiding redundancy:

1. For a vegetable炒め with 豚バラ肉:
  - Side Dish: 味噌汁 with 乾燥わかめ and 豆腐
  - Reasoning: This side dish adds a contrasting texture and flavor to the main dish. The わかめ and 豆腐 provide a subtle seaweed and soft tofu taste, which complements the savory 豚バラ肉 and vegetables.

2. For 回鍋肉 with 豚バラ肉:
  - Side Dish: 野菜スティック with ごま油 and 塩
  - Reasoning: This side dish offers a fresh and crunchy contrast to the rich and savory 回鍋肉. The ごま油 and 塩 dressing adds a hint of nuttiness and savoriness, enhancing the overall flavor experience.

3. For 麻婆豆腐 with 豚バラ肉:
  - Side Dish: 野菜の浅漬け with 塩昆布
  - Reasoning: The acidic and slightly sweet flavor of the 浅漬け provides a nice balance to the spicy and savory 麻婆豆腐. The 塩昆布 adds a subtle umami taste, elevating the side dish.

4. For 親子丼 with 鶏もも肉:
  - Side Dish: 冷奴 with 醤油 and ごま油
  - Reasoning: The 冷奴 offers a cooling and refreshing contrast to the warm 親子丼. The 醤油 and ごま油 dressing adds a touch of richness and nuttiness, complementing the main dish.

5. For 野菜たっぷりの焼きそば with 豚バラ肉:
  - Side Dish: フルーツサラダ with ヨーグルトドレッシング
  - Reasoning: The fruit salad provides a sweet and refreshing contrast to the savory 焼きそば. The ヨーグルトドレッシング adds a creamy and tangy flavor, which can help cut through the richness of the main dish.

These side dish options ensure variety in the meal's components while complementing the chosen main dish flavor profile.
