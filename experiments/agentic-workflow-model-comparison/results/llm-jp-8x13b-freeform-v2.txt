# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.

**Current Phase: Planning**

- Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
- Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Create 3-5 concrete steps to achieve the objective
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)

### 応答:

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: :
Based on the available proteins and vegetables, as well as the objective to identify potential main dishes, I have analyzed the ingredients and come up with the following potential main dishes:

1. 鶏もも肉と野菜の炒め物: This dish would utilize the chicken thighs and a mix of vegetables such as carrots, bell peppers, and onions. The cooking method would involve stir-frying the chicken and vegetables in oil, seasoned with salt, pepper, and soy sauce. This dish offers a variety of textures and flavors, making it an excellent choice for dinner.

2. 豚バラ肉とキャベツの蒸し煮: This dish would use the pork belly and cabbage. The cooking method involves layering the pork and cabbage in a pot, then covering and steaming it until the pork is cooked through and the cabbage is tender. The dish can be seasoned with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of sesame oil. This dish is easy to prepare and provides a comforting, warm meal.

3. 野菜たっぷりのオムレツ: This dish would use the eggs and a mix of available vegetables like carrots, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The cooking method involves sautéing the vegetables until tender, then whisking the eggs and incorporating the vegetables. The omelette can be seasoned with salt, pepper, and a touch of soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce. This dish offers a quick and versatile option for dinner.

4. 豆腐と野菜の味噌炒め: This dish would use the tofu and a mix of vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and snow peas. The cooking method involves stir-frying the vegetables and tofu, then adding a sauce made from miso paste, sugar, and soy sauce. This dish provides a protein-packed meal with a savory, umami flavor.

5. 野菜とわかめのスープ: This dish would use the available vegetables and dried wakame seaweed. The cooking method involves simmering the vegetables and wakame in a broth made from dashi or vegetable stock. The soup can be seasoned with salt and soy sauce. This dish offers a light and nourishing meal option.

These potential main dishes utilize the available ingredients while considering variety in cooking methods and avoiding consecutive use of the same ingredients.

Considering the instructions and the past meals, I recommend selecting the "豚バラ肉とキャベツの蒸し煮" as the main dish for today's dinner. This dish meets the criteria of using ingredients not used in the past two days and provides a balanced meal with protein and vegetables. Additionally, it offers a different cooking method compared to the previous meals, making it a well-rounded choice for today's dinner.

Based on the available proteins and vegetables, as well as the objective to identify potential main dishes, I have analyzed the ingredients and come up with the following potential main dishes:

1. 鶏もも肉と野菜の炒め物: This dish would utilize the chicken thighs and a mix of vegetables such as carrots, bell peppers, and onions.

This dish offers a variety of textures and flavors, making it an excellent choice for dinner.

2. 豚バラ肉とキャベツの蒸し煮: This dish would use the pork belly and cabbage. The cooking method involves layering the pork and cabbage in a pot, then covering and steaming it until the pork is cooked through and the cabbage is tender. The dish can be seasoned with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of sesame oil. This dish is easy to prepare and provides a comforting, warm meal.

3. 野菜たっぷりのオムレツ: This dish would use the eggs and a mix of available vegetables like carrots, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The cooking method involves sautéing the vegetables until tender, then whisking the eggs and incorporating the vegetables. The omelette can be seasoned with salt, pepper, and a touch of soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce. This dish offers a quick and versatile option for dinner.

4. 豆腐と野菜の味噌炒め: This dish would use the tofu and a mix of vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and snow peas. The cooking method involves stir-frying the vegetables and tofu, then adding a sauce made from miso paste, sugar, and soy sauce. This dish provides a protein-packed meal with a savory, umami flavor.

5. 野菜とわかめのスープ: This dish would use the available vegetables and dried wakame seaweed. The cooking method involves simmering the vegetables and wakame in a broth made from dashi or vegetable stock. The soup can be seasoned with salt and soy sauce. This dish offers a light and nourishing meal option.
