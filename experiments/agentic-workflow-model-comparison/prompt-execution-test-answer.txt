Based on the previous step's result, I propose the following side dishes to complement the main dish "鶏もも肉と野菜の炒め物":

1. **冷奴 (Cold Tofu)**
  - Utilizes available "豆腐 1丁"
  - A simple and refreshing side dish that balances the richness of the main dish
  - To prepare: Cut the tofu into cubes, sprinkle with a dash of "醤油" and "ごま油", and serve chilled

2. **ポテトサラダ (Potato Salad)**
  - Uses available "じゃがいも 3個"
  - Adds a creamy and tangy flavor to the meal
  - To prepare: Boil the potatoes, peel and mash them, mix with "マヨネーズ" (if available), "塩", and "コショウ", and add chopped "きゅうり" (if available) or "人参" (if available) for color and texture

3. **キャベツの浅漬け (Quick Pickled Cabbage)**
  - Utilizes available "キャベツ"
  - Adds a crunchy and slightly tangy element to the meal
  - To prepare: Shred the cabbage, mix with "塩" and "昆布茶" (if available), let it marinate for 15-20 minutes, and drain excess liquid before serving

These side dishes utilize available refrigerator items and provide a balanced and flavorful meal, avoiding repetition of similar side dishes from past meals.
