# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.

**Current Phase: Planning**

- Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
- Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Create 3-5 concrete steps to achieve the objective
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)
- Start directly with { and end with }

### 応答:

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: :
Based on the available proteins and vegetables in the refrigerator inventory, here are some potential main dishes that focus on variety and nutritional balance:

1. Stir-fried Chicken with Vegetables:
- Use 300g of 鶏もも肉 (chicken thighs) as the protein source.
- Include a mix of vegetables such as キャベツ (cabbage), 人参 (carrots), and ピーマン (bell peppers) for color and nutrients.
- Add some of the seasonings like 醤油 (soy sauce), みりん (mirin), and ごま油 (sesame oil) for flavor.

2. Vegetable Fried Rice:
- Utilize 200g of 豚バラ肉 (pork belly) as the protein source.
- Incorporate ご飯 (rice) from the other items in the refrigerator.
- Add a variety of vegetables like 玉ねぎ (onions), 人参 (carrots), and もやし (bean sprouts) for a balanced dish.
- Season with 醤油 (soy sauce), 塩 (salt), and コショウ (pepper) for taste.

3. Tofu and Vegetable Stir-fry:
- Use 1丁 (block) of 豆腐 (tofu) as the protein source.
- Include a mix of vegetables like キャベツ (cabbage), 人参 (carrots), and 玉ねぎ (onions).
- Add seasonings like 醤油 (soy sauce), みりん (mirin), and 酒 (sake) for flavor.

These dishes utilize the available ingredients while considering variety and nutritional balance. They can be easily adjusted based on personal preferences or dietary restrictions.

### 応答:

Execution step step-2 - AI generated: **Step 1: Review past meals to identify patterns**

Based on the provided data, the past three meals had the following main dishes:

1. Yesterday: カレーライス（豚肉・じゃがいも・人参・玉ねぎ） (Curry rice with pork, potatoes, carrots, and onions)
2.一昨日: 生姜焼き（豚肉・玉ねぎ） (Ginger-fried pork with onions)
3. 3日前: 鶏の照り焼き（鶏もも肉） (Teriyaki chicken with chicken thighs)

From these meals, we can identify patterns in the main proteins and vegetables used:

- Proteins: Chicken thighs, pork belly, and tofu are available in the refrigerator. The past meals primarily used pork and chicken.
- Vegetables: The past meals used a variety of vegetables, including potatoes, carrots, onions, and cabbage.

**Step 2: Choose a main dish that offers a new flavor profile**

Considering the available proteins and vegetables, as well as the need to avoid repeating main dishes from the past three days, I propose the following main dish:

Stir-fried Chicken with Vegetables

- Use 300g of 鶏もも肉 (chicken thighs) as the protein source.
- Include a mix of vegetables such as キャベツ (cabbage), 人参 (carrots), and ピーマン (bell peppers) for color and nutrients.
- Add some of the seasonings like 醤油 (soy sauce), みりん (mirin), and ごま油 (sesame oil) for flavor.

This dish offers a new flavor profile compared to the past meals, as it features chicken thighs and a variety of vegetables that were not used in the previous main dishes. It also ensures a balanced intake of nutrients and avoids repeating the same main dish from the past three days.

2.一昨日: 生姜焼き（豚肉・玉ねぎ） (Ginger-fried pork with onions)
3. 3日前: 鶏の照り焼き（鶏もも肉） (Teriyaki chicken with chicken thighs)

From these meals, we can identify patterns in the main proteins and vegetables used:

- Proteins: Chicken thighs, pork belly, and tofu are available in the refrigerator. The past meals primarily used pork and chicken.
- Vegetables: The past meals used a variety of vegetables, including potatoes, carrots, onions, and cabbage.

**Step 2: Choose a main dish that offers a new flavor profile**

Considering the available proteins and vegetables, as well as the need to avoid repeating main dishes from the past three days, I propose the following main dish:

Stir-fried Chicken with Vegetables

- Use 300g of 鶏もも肉 (chicken thighs) as the protein source.
- Include a mix of vegetables such as キャベツ (cabbage), 人参 (carrots), and ピーマン (bell peppers) for color and nutrients.
- Add some of the seasonings like 醤油 (soy sauce), みりん (mirin), and ごま油 (sesame oil) for flavor.

This dish offers a new flavor profile compared to the past meals, as it features chicken thighs and a variety of vegetables that were not used in the previous main dishes. It also ensures a balanced intake of nutrients and avoids repeating the same main dish from the past three days.
