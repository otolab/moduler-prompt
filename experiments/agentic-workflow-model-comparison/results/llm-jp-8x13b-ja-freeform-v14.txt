# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.
- **Current Phase: Planning**
  - Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
  - Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Create 3-5 concrete steps to achieve the objective
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)
- Start directly with { and end with }

# Output

This section is where you write your response.

### 応答:

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: :
Based on the available ingredients in the refrigerator, here are three possible main dishes you can make for dinner tonight:

1. Stir-fried Chicken with Garlic Sauce:
Using the 300g of chicken thighs, you can make a flavorful stir-fry. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and stir-fry them in a pan with some oil until cooked. Add minced garlic, salt, and pepper to taste, and cook for an additional minute. This dish is simple yet delicious and can be served with rice.

2. Tofu Stir-fry with Vegetables:
With one block of tofu available, you can create a healthy and balanced dish. Cut the tofu into cubes and stir-fry it in a pan with some oil until golden brown. Add sliced carrots, sliced potatoes, and chopped bell peppers to the pan and stir-fry until the vegetables are tender. Season with soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. This stir-fry can be served as a main dish or as a side dish.

3. Fried Rice with Mixed Vegetables:
Using the 200g of pork belly, slice it into thin strips and set aside. In a pan, stir-fry the rice with some oil until heated through. Add the sliced pork, chopped carrots, chopped potatoes, and chopped bell peppers. Mix well and add soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. This fried rice dish is a great way to use up the remaining ingredients in the refrigerator and can be served as a main dish.

These are just a few ideas based on the available ingredients. You can always adjust the recipes to your liking and add additional ingredients if desired.

### 応答:

Execution step step-3 - AI generated: :
Based on the available ingredients in the refrigerator and the past meals, here are three possible side dishes that complement the chosen main dish:

1. **Vegetable Fried Rice**: Using the remaining vegetables from the past meals (carrots, potatoes, bell peppers, and onions), you can create a flavorful fried rice. Sauté the vegetables in a pan with some oil until tender, then add the cooked rice and stir-fry until well combined. Season with soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. This side dish is versatile and can be paired with any of the main dishes mentioned earlier.

2. **Tofu and Vegetable Stir-fry**: With the leftover tofu from the previous step, you can create a balanced and delicious stir-fry. Cut the tofu into cubes and stir-fry it in a pan with some oil until golden brown. Add the remaining vegetables (carrots, potatoes, and bell peppers) and stir-fry until tender. Season with soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. This side dish is not only healthy but also complements the main dishes well.

3. **Mushroom and Vegetable Salad**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the refrigerator ingredients, you can use dried mushrooms (from the "other" section) to make a flavorful salad. Rehydrate the dried mushrooms in warm water, then chop them and mix with the remaining vegetables (carrots, potatoes, and bell peppers). Add a simple vinaigrette made from olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and toss to combine. This side dish adds a touch of freshness and elegance to the dinner table.

These side dishes are designed to complement the chosen main dish while utilizing the available ingredients and avoiding repetition from past meals.

This stir-fry can be served as a main dish or as a side dish.
