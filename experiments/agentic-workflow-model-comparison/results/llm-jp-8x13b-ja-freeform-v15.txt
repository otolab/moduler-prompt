# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.
- **Current Phase: Planning**
  - Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
  - Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Break down the **Objective and Instructions shown above** into 3-5 concrete executable steps
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
  - **dos**: Specific actions or guidelines TO DO in this step
  - **donts**: Specific actions or guidelines NOT TO DO in this step
- The steps should accomplish the Instructions in a logical sequence
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)
- Start directly with { and end with }

### 応答:

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: :
Based on the requirements and the available ingredients in the refrigerator, I will select a main dish for today's dinner. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. Check the available proteins: 鶏もも肉 300g, 豚バラ肉 200g, 卵 6個, and 豆腐 1丁.
2. Consider using chicken thigh meat (300g) or pork belly meat (200g) as they are both available and popular choices for main dishes.
3. Avoid using the same protein type consecutively, as the past meals had pork and chicken in the last three days.
4. Consider using eggs (6 pieces) as a main dish option, as they are a versatile and nutritious choice.
5. Review the available vegetables and seasonings to create a balanced and flavorful dish.

Considering the above points, I recommend making a stir-fried dish with 豚バラ肉 (200g) and 野菜 (vegetables) such as キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, and ピーマン. This dish can be seasoned with 醤油, みりん, 酒, and ごま油 for a savory and aromatic flavor. This option provides a different protein type from the past meals and utilizes a variety of vegetables for a balanced and delicious dinner.

Here's the reasoning process and results as natural text:

1. Checked available proteins: 鶏もも肉 300g, 豚バラ肉 200g, 卵 6個, and 豆腐 1丁.
2. Considered using chicken thigh meat (300g) or pork belly meat (200g).
3. Avoided using the same protein type consecutively.
4. Considered using eggs (6 pieces) as a main dish option.
5. Reviewed available vegetables and seasonings.
6. Recommended stir-fried 豚バラ肉 (200g) with 野菜 (キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, and ピーマン) and seasoned with 醤油, みりん, 酒, and ごま油.

This recommendation meets the requirements and utilizes the available ingredients in the refrigerator while avoiding repetition of protein types from past meals.

### 応答:

Execution step step-2 - AI generated: :
Based on the given instructions and the current state of the refrigerator, I propose the following side dishes that complement the chosen main dish:

1. **Stir-fried Vegetables (キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, and ピーマン) with 豚バラ肉 (200g)**
  - This dish will utilize the available vegetables and pork belly meat, providing a balanced and flavorful option. The stir-fry method ensures a different cooking technique compared to the previous main dish, which was a curry.

2. **Miso Soup with Tofu (1丁)**
  - To create a comforting and light dish, use the available tofu and miso paste. Add some 乾燥わかめ and scallions for extra flavor and nutrition. This dish will provide a different texture and taste compared to the main dish and the previous side dish.

3. **Rice with Seasoned Egg (卵 6個)**
  - To make a simple yet delicious side dish, hard-boil the eggs and slice them. Mix them with a bit of soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil. Serve the seasoned eggs over rice for a satisfying and protein-packed option. This dish will offer a different cooking technique and flavor compared to the main dish and the previous side dish.

These side dishes meet the requirements of building upon previous step results, using different cooking methods, and considering the available vegetables in the refrigerator. They also avoid repeating the same type of dish consecutively and do not require any ingredients not available in the refrigerator.

Execution step step-3 - AI generated: :
Based on the given instructions and the current state of the refrigerator, I propose the following side dishes that complement the chosen main dish:

1. **Stir-fried Vegetables (キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, and ピーマン) with 豚バラ肉 (200g)**
  - This dish will utilize the available vegetables and pork belly meat, providing a balanced and flavorful option. The stir-fry method ensures a different cooking technique compared to the previous main dish, which was a curry.

2. **Miso Soup with Tofu (1丁)**
  - To create a comforting and light dish, use the available tofu and miso paste. Add some 乾燥わかめ and scallions for extra flavor and nutrition. This dish will provide a different texture and taste compared to the main dish and the previous side dish.

3. **Rice with Seasoned Egg (卵 6個)**
  - To make a simple yet delicious side dish, hard-boil the eggs and slice them. Mix them with a bit of soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil. Serve the seasoned eggs over rice for a satisfying and protein-packed option. This dish will offer a different cooking technique and flavor compared to the main dish and the previous side dish.

These side dishes meet the requirements of building upon previous step results, using different cooking methods, and considering the available vegetables in the refrigerator. They also avoid repeating the same type of dish consecutively and do not require any ingredients not available in the refrigerator.

To check for any missing ingredients, let's compare the selected main dish and side dishes with the available ingredients:

- Main Dish: Stir-fried 豚バラ肉 (200g) with 野菜 (キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, and ピーマン)
- Side Dishes:
 1. Stir-fried Vegetables (キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, and ピーマン) with 豚バラ肉 (200g)
 2. Miso Soup with Tofu (1丁)
 3. Rice with Seasoned Egg (卵 6個)

All the ingredients required for the main dish and side dishes are available in the refrigerator. Therefore, there are no missing ingredients for the chosen menu.

[Step 1] step-1
:
Based on the requirements and the available ingredients in the refrigerator, I will select a main dish for today's dinner. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. Check the available proteins: 鶏もも肉 300g, 豚バラ肉 200g, 卵 6個, and 豆腐 1丁.
2. Consider using chicken thigh meat (300g) or pork belly meat (200g) as they are both available and popular choices for main dishes.
3. Avoid using the same protein type consecutively, as the past meals had pork and chicken in the last three days.
4. Consider using eggs (6 pieces) as a main dish option, as they are a versatile and nutritious choice.
5. Review the available vegetables and seasonings to create a balanced and flavorful dish.

Considering the above points, I recommend making a stir-fried dish with 豚バラ肉 (200g) and 野菜 (vegetables) such as キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, and ピーマン. This dish can be seasoned with 醤油, みりん, 酒, and ごま油 for a savory and aromatic flavor. This option provides a different protein type from the past meals and utilizes a variety of vegetables for a balanced and delicious dinner.
