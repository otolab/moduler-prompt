# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.

**Current Phase: Planning**

- Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
- Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Create 3-5 concrete steps to achieve the objective
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)
- Start directly with { and end with }

# Output

This section is where you write your response.

## Output

- Execute the current step following the dos/donts.
- Explain your reasoning and what you accomplished.
- Output your response as natural text (not JSON).

### 応答:

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: : Considering the available data, I will determine the protein and vegetables to be used for dinner, following the given instructions and constraints.

First, I will list down the available proteins and vegetables:

Proteins: 鶏もも肉, 豚バラ肉, 卵, 豆腐
Vegetables: キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

Next, I will consider the combinations of proteins and vegetables in the refrigerator.

Possible combinations:
1. 鶏もも肉 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし
2. 豚バラ肉 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし
3. 卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし
4. 豆腐 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

Now, I will ensure the chosen protein is not repeated from the past three meals.

- The protein used in the last meal was 鶏もも肉.
- The protein used in the second-to-last meal was 豚バラ肉.
- The protein used in the third-to-last meal was 卵.

Based on the above information, I will eliminate the following combinations:
1. 鶏もも肉 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし (repeated protein from the last meal)
2. 豚バラ肉 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし (repeated protein from the second-to-last meal)

This leaves us with the following combinations:
1. 卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし
2. 豆腐 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

I will choose one of the remaining combinations for dinner. Let's select:

卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

Reasoning:
- I have considered the combinations of proteins and vegetables in the refrigerator.
- I have ensured the chosen protein is not repeated from the past three meals.

Accomplished:
- Determined the protein and vegetables for dinner: 卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

Output:
For dinner, I recommend using 卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし. This combination follows the given instructions and constraints, ensuring a varied and nutritious meal.

### Previous step result: step-1
*ID: execution-result-step-1*

[Result]
: Considering the available data, I will determine the protein and vegetables to be used for dinner, following the given instructions and constraints.

First, I will list down the available proteins and vegetables:

Proteins: 鶏もも肉, 豚バラ肉, 卵, 豆腐
Vegetables: キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

Next, I will consider the combinations of proteins and vegetables in the refrigerator.

Possible combinations:
1. 鶏もも肉 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし
2. 豚バラ肉 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし
3. 卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし
4. 豆腐 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

Now, I will ensure the chosen protein is not repeated from the past three meals.

- The protein used in the last meal was 鶏もも肉.
- The protein used in the second-to-last meal was 豚バラ肉.
- The protein used in the third-to-last meal was 卵.

Based on the above information, I will eliminate the following combinations:
1. 鶏もも肉 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし (repeated protein from the last meal)
2. 豚バラ肉 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし (repeated protein from the second-to-last meal)

This leaves us with the following combinations:
1. 卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし
2. 豆腐 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

I will choose one of the remaining combinations for dinner. Let's select:

卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

Reasoning:
- I have considered the combinations of proteins and vegetables in the refrigerator.
- I have ensured the chosen protein is not repeated from the past three meals.

Accomplished:
- Determined the protein and vegetables for dinner: 卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし

Output:
For dinner, I recommend using 卵 with キャベツ, 人参, 玉ねぎ, じゃがいも, ピーマン, もやし. This combination follows the given instructions and constraints, ensuring a varied and nutritious meal.
