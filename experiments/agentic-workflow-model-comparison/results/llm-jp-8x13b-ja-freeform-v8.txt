# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.
- **Current Phase: Planning**
  - Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
  - Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Create 3-5 concrete steps to achieve the objective
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)

### 応答:

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: :
Based on the available ingredients in your refrigerator and the instructions provided, I have identified a potential main dish for your dinner tonight. Here's the reasoning process and the result:

1. I considered combinations of proteins and vegetables from the "proteins" and "vegetables" lists in the "refrigerator" data.
2. To avoid repeating similar dishes from past meals, I excluded any combinations that were similar to the main dishes from the past three days. Specifically, I avoided using pork with onions and carrots, as in the recent pork katsu dish, and chicken, as in the recent chicken teriyaki dish.
3. I also ensured that the dish would not have a similar flavor profile to the previous day's meal, which was a curry. To achieve this, I avoided using strong flavors like curry or heavy spices.

Considering these factors, I have suggested a dish that meets all the criteria:

Main Dish: 鶏と野菜の甘酢炒め (Sweet and Sour Chicken with Vegetables)

Ingredients:
- 鶏もも肉 (300g)
- キャベツ (1/4)
- 人参 (1/2)
- 玉ねぎ (1)
- ピーマン (1)
- サラダ油 (適量)
- 醤油 (大さじ1)
- みりん (大さじ1)
- 酒 (大さじ1)
- 砂糖 (大さじ1)
- 酢 (大さじ1)
- 塩・コショウ (少々)

Instructions:
1. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper.
2. Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces as well.
3. Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat and stir-fry the chicken until cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the vegetables and stir-fry until tender-crisp.
5. Return the chicken to the pan and add the sweet and sour sauce (mix of soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, and vinegar). Cook for an additional minute until heated through.

This dish offers a balance of flavors and textures, and it does not repeat any recent main dishes or their flavor profiles.

📝 Execution Log:

[Step 1] step-1
:
Based on the available ingredients in your refrigerator and the instructions provided, I have identified a potential main dish for your dinner tonight. Here's the reasoning process and the result:

1. I considered combinations of proteins and vegetables from the "proteins" and "vegetables" lists in the "refrigerator" data.
2. To avoid repeating similar dishes from past meals, I excluded any combinations that were similar to the main dishes from the past three days. Specifically, I avoided using pork with onions and carrots, as in the recent pork katsu dish, and chicken, as in the recent chicken teriyaki dish.
3. I also ensured that the dish would not have a similar flavor profile to the previous day's meal, which was a curry. To achieve this, I avoided using strong flavors like curry or heavy spices.

Considering these factors, I have suggested a dish that meets all the criteria:

Main Dish: 鶏と野菜の甘酢炒め (Sweet and Sour Chicken with Vegetables)

Ingredients:
- 鶏もも肉 (300g)
- キャベツ (1/4)
- 人参 (1/2)
- 玉ねぎ (1)
- ピーマン (1)
- サラダ油 (適量)
- 醤油 (大さじ1)
- みりん (大さじ1)
- 酒 (大さじ1)
- 砂糖 (大さじ1)
- 酢 (大さじ1)
- 塩・コショウ (少々)

Instructions:
1. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper.
2. Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces as well.
3. Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat and stir-fry the chicken until cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the vegetables and stir-fry until tender-crisp.
5. Return the chicken to the pan and add the sweet and sour sauce (mix of soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, and vinegar). Cook for an additional minute until heated through.

This dish offers a balance of flavors and textures, and it does not repeat any recent main dishes or their flavor profiles.
