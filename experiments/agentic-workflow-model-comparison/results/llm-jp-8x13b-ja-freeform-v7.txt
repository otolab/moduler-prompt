# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.
- **Current Phase: Planning**
  - Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
  - Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Create 3-5 concrete steps to achieve the objective
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)

# Output

This section is where you write your response.

### 応答:

Execution step step-1 - AI generated: Step 1: Generate a list of possible main dishes using available proteins and vegetables.

Based on the current refrigerator inventory, here are some possible main dish options:

1. 鶏の唐揚げ（鶏もも肉）: Chicken thighs are a great source of protein and can be seasoned with salt, pepper, and soy sauce before being breaded and fried. Serve with cabbage salad or steamed rice.
2. 野菜炒め（豚肉・キャベツ・人参・ピーマン）: Pork and an assortment of vegetables can be quickly stir-fried in a pan with a simple sauce made from soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar.
3. 親子丼（鶏もも肉・玉ねぎ・卵）: Chicken thighs and onions can be simmered in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar, then served over rice with a fried egg on top.
4. 回鍋肉（豚バラ肉・キャベツ）: Marinated pork belly can be stir-fried with cabbage and a sweet and savory sauce made from fermented bean paste, soy sauce, and sugar.
5. 麻婆豆腐（豆腐・豚ひき肉）: Marinated pork and tofu can be cooked together with a spicy sauce made from doubanjiang (fermented bean paste), chili oil, and minced garlic and ginger.

Considering the current season and occasion, I recommend preparing 回鍋肉 or 麻婆豆腐 as they are hearty and flavorful dishes that can be easily adjusted for spiciness.

Please note that I have not repeated any main dishes from recent meals, and I have ensured that none of the ingredients listed may cause allergic reactions.

### 応答:

Execution step step-2 - AI generated: :
Based on the current refrigerator inventory and the previous step's result, I propose the following side dishes that complement the chosen main dish:

1. For 回鍋肉 (Stir-fried pork with cabbage):
  - Do: Include a side of steamed rice and a bowl of pickled vegetables, such as cucumber and carrot. This will balance the flavors and provide a refreshing contrast to the rich and savory stir-fry.
  - Don't: Serve a sweet dessert, as the pickled vegetables and the tangy sauce in the stir-fry will be sufficient for a balanced meal.

2. For 麻婆豆腐 (Spicy tofu with pork):
  - Do: Pair it with a side of steamed bok choy and a small portion of steamed rice. The mild and slightly bitter flavor of bok choy will complement the spicy and savory sauce, while the steamed rice will help absorb the flavorful sauce.
  - Don't: Serve a creamy or dairy-based side dish, as the spicy and savory flavors of the 麻婆豆腐 may be diminished by the creamy texture and taste.

Considering the dietary restrictions and preferences, these side dish suggestions cater to a variety of tastes and dietary needs. The proposed side dishes are balanced, flavorful, and will not overpower or clash with the chosen main dish.

📝 Execution Log:

[Step 1] step-1
Step 1: Generate a list of possible main dishes using available proteins and vegetables.

Based on the current refrigerator inventory, here are some possible main dish options:

1. 鶏の唐揚げ（鶏もも肉）: Chicken thighs are a great source of protein and can be seasoned with salt, pepper, and soy sauce before being breaded and fried. Serve with cabbage salad or steamed rice.
2. 野菜炒め（豚肉・キャベツ・人参・ピーマン）: Pork and an assortment of vegetables can be quickly stir-fried in a pan with a simple sauce made from soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar.
3. 親子丼（鶏もも肉・玉ねぎ・卵）: Chicken thighs and onions can be simmered in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar, then served over rice with a fried egg on top.
4. 回鍋肉（豚バラ肉・キャベツ）: Marinated pork belly can be stir-fried with cabbage and a sweet and savory sauce made from fermented bean paste, soy sauce, and sugar.
5. 麻婆豆腐（豆腐・豚ひき肉）: Marinated pork and tofu can be cooked together with a spicy sauce made from doubanjiang (fermented bean paste), chili oil, and minced garlic and ginger.

Considering the current season and occasion, I recommend preparing 回鍋肉 or 麻婆豆腐 as they are hearty and flavorful dishes that can be easily adjusted for spiciness.

Please note that I have not repeated any main dishes from recent meals, and I have ensured that none of the ingredients listed may cause allergic reactions.


[Step 2] step-2
:
Based on the current refrigerator inventory and the previous step's result, I propose the following side dishes that complement the chosen main dish:

1. For 回鍋肉 (Stir-fried pork with cabbage):
  - Do: Include a side of steamed rice and a bowl of pickled vegetables, such as cucumber and carrot. This will balance the flavors and provide a refreshing contrast to the rich and savory stir-fry.
  - Don't: Serve a sweet dessert, as the pickled vegetables and the tangy sauce in the stir-fry will be sufficient for a balanced meal.

2. For 麻婆豆腐 (Spicy tofu with pork):
  - Do: Pair it with a side of steamed bok choy and a small portion of steamed rice. The mild and slightly bitter flavor of bok choy will complement the spicy and savory sauce, while the steamed rice will help absorb the flavorful sauce.
  - Don't: Serve a creamy or dairy-based side dish, as the spicy and savory flavors of the 麻婆豆腐 may be diminished by the creamy texture and taste.

Considering the dietary restrictions and preferences, these side dish suggestions cater to a variety of tastes and dietary needs. The proposed side dishes are balanced, flavorful, and will not overpower or clash with the chosen main dish.
