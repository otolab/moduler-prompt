# Instructions

The following instructions should be prioritized and directly guide your actions.

## Objective and Role

今日の夕飯の献立を決定する

## Term Explanations

- Execution Plan: Objective and Instructions broken down into executable steps
- Action: External tool/API to use during execution (e.g., data retrieval, calculations)

## Processing Methodology

- Agentic workflow executes complex tasks through multi-step processing.
- This workflow has three phases: Planning → Execution → Integration.
  - Planning: analyzes the objective to create an execution plan.
  - Execution: processes each step sequentially, recording results.
  - Integration: combines all results into the final output.
- **Current Phase: Planning**
  - Generate an execution plan by breaking down the Objective and Instructions into 3-5 executable steps.
  - Output structured JSON text immediately, with no explanations or commentary.

## Instructions

- 冷蔵庫の材料から作れる主菜候補を検討する
- 過去の献立と比較し、似たものが続かないようにする
- 選んだ主菜に合う副菜を提案する
- 不足している材料があれば買い出しリストを作成する
- 最終的な出力は日本語で行うこと

### Planning Requirements

- Break down the **Objective and Instructions shown above** into 3-5 concrete executable steps
- Each step must have: id, description, dos (2-4 items), donts (1-3 items)
  - **dos**: Specific actions or guidelines TO DO in this step
  - **donts**: Specific actions or guidelines NOT TO DO in this step
- The steps should accomplish the Instructions in a logical sequence
- Consider available tools when defining actions (currently none available)
- Ensure logical flow between steps

**CRITICAL: Output Format**
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON text
- NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)
- Start directly with { and end with }
